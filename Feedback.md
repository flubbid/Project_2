#### Feedback:  
Brendan, great project! Code is clean, & concise. I think the ingredient 
<br>feature worked out nicely because it displayed only the ones relevent 
<br>to the recipe. There is a typo on line 12, in controllers/ingredients.js.
<br>Also, I know I've seen your wire framse, but be sure to throw that (and ERD)
<br>either in the trello, or read me file. Finally, dont't forget to put the <br>deployment link in the read me too! Otherwise, outstanding work my friend!
